# NBA Map


#### Background and Overview

The motivation behind NBA Maps is my curiosity in the algorithm behind how a professional sports league comes out with an algorithm to create a schedule for a season. I also have an interest in their travels and how each team travels over the 8 months season across the country.

There's 30 teams in the league.       
Each team plays 82 games.      
That's 2460 games to account for.

This application will have a timeline for which ever team you select, and have a short timeline and timer to show the route a team takes, including the time frame where they start, their roadtrips, and going from mid October to mid May.

#### Functionality and MVP
* Renders Interactive Google Maps
* Sports API gathering NBA season schedule
* Animation of team travling from city to city based on time
